# Digital-Hour

An hour, regularly dedicated to sharing our work, ideas and knowledge with eachother within the CISO organization. We will start within our organization, but if you aren't in the CISO and wan't to participate we'll always welcome anyone interested!

This repository will hold all the materials and information for past and upcoming sessions.
